## Machine Learning code examples in Google Colab
   - [Several callback examples](callbacks_usage_in_training.ipynb).
     Callbacks are used to stop training to avoid overfitting or if learning rate is enough.
   - [U-Net segmentation](unet_segmentation.ipynb) is a convolutional neural network that was developed
     for biomedical image segmentation at the Computer Science Department of the University of Freiburg,
     Germany. [Wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-Net).
     The network is based on the fully convolutional network and its architecture was modified
     and extended to work with fewer training images and to yield more precise segmentations.
     Segmentation of a 512*512 image takes less than a second on a modern GPU.
   - [Deep Residual U-Net (ResUNet)](deep_residual_unet_segmentation.ipynb) based on residual
     neural network and U-Net.
